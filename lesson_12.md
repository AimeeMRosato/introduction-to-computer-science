## Instructor's Notes

* Introductory discussion
  * Review the basics of SNAP from the previous lesson
  * Introduce the concept of block categories
    * Ask students to consider why categories are helpful as opposed to having a simple list of blocks
* Activity
  * Individually or in pairs, have students work through the "SNAP Scavenger Hunt" activity
    * Students should turn in answers to all questions and SNAP programs for the final problems
* Review
  * Go through each of the categories and ensure students understand how each works.
    * Point out the color coding for each category
  * Discuss one or two student solutions to each of the SNAP programming problems
    * Either solicit volunteers or cold call.
    * Point out differences between student solutions and call attention to the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Colorblind students may not be able to identify the block colors, but can still recognize the organization of categories. Be sensitive to this, but no modifications are likely required.
* Students that are struggling with the lab can be paired up and/or receive individual instructor attention to help them through the activity.

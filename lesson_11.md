# Lesson 1.1
## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify "blocks," "scripts," "sprites," and "the stage" in SNAP.
* Write simple SNAP programs
* Describe what simple SNAP programs do without executing the code

## Materials/Preparation

* [Lab 1.1 handout](lab_11.md) (Welcome to SNAP!) 
* Ensure that all classroom computers can access http://snap.berkeley.edu/run.
* Read through the lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students as needed

## Instructor's Notes
1. Introductory discussion
  * Review the definitions of "algorithm" and "program" developed in lesson 0.2
      * _algorithm: a complete, well-defined sequence of steps for completing a task or solving a problem_
      * _program: a sequence of instructions or steps, written in a language that can be understood by a computer, that will be used by the computer to complete a task or solve a problem_
  

2. Activity Walkthrough
    * Work through [Lab 1.1](lab_11.md) up through part 3 (scripts) as a class.
        * Point out key aspects of SNAP in each section, including:
            * the sections of the window in part 1
            * block shapes and color-coding of categories in part 2
                * simply draw attention to the different shapes at this point; their meanings will be covered as each block type is introduced
            * the "drag-and-drop" nature of the language
            * running blocks/scripts by clicking on them
        * Ensure that all students are able to create an account and save their work, as describe in the preamble of the lab
    
2. Activity
  * Individually or in pairs, have students work through the "Welcome to SNAP" lab activity. Students should answer all questions and complete all activities and turn them in using your chosen turn-in procedure.
    * For written questions, either have students hand-write answers and turn in the hard copies or set up an electronic submission system of some kind.
    * For SNAP programs, including the Kaleidoscope program, students should save the program to the cloud and share a link with you

3. Turn-in procedures
  * Demonstrate the turn-in procedure you will use for student work throughout the semester, and have students follow along to turn in their work from the lab.
    * Ensure that each student is able to turn in their work before the class period ends.

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* For students that finish the lab early, encourage them to add more advanced features to their Kaleidoscope program, exploring parts of SNAP not covered in the lab.

* Students that are struggling with the lab can be paired up and/or receive individual instructor attention to help them through the activity.

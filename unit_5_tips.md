| Cloning     |  A feature that allows a sprite to create a clone, or semi-duplicate, of itself, while the project is running. Clones of a sprite will be the same as the original or parent sprite but as a separate instance. Clones inherit the parent's scripts, costumes, sounds, and properties, yet they can then be modified. 
| GLobal Variable     | A variable  that can be used by all of your sprites. |

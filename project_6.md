# Project 6 - Final Project
Students will design, plan, and implement a medium- to large-scale final project of their own choosing.

## Overview
During this course, you have learned a huge amount about computer science and programming in general, and SNAP in particular.  In this project, you will put all of that knowledge, along with some new skills you will develop around design, planning, and project management, to build a relatively large and complex application that _you_ choose.  You can create almost anything you want and should ultimately produce a project that is interesting, useful, and challenging.

## Details
1. **Project Steps** <br />
This project will be significantly larger in scope than any of your previous assignments, so there will be more design and planning than before.  More importantly, though, rather than be given a well-defined specification, _YOU_ will be setting the requirements for your project by coming up with an idea, fleshing out the details, and defining the steps necessary to complete your program.
<p />
To help you through this process, there will be several steps to this project.  You must complete **all** of the steps **in order** for your project to be successful.  In fact, _half_ of your grade will be based not on how well your program works, but on how well you completed the design and planning process.
<p />
The steps to the project will be:
    1. _Brainstorming_ - coming up with as many possible project ideas as you can
    2. _Pitching_ - choosing a few ideas and developing a short description of what the project will entail
    3. _Reviewing_ - getting feedback from your peers and instructors on your pitches and choosing one
    4. _Defining_ - listing out the features the project will need and what they will look like
    5. _Wireframing_ - drawing simple sketches of what the various "screens" in your program will look like
    6. _Designing_ - fleshing out all the specifics of how the project will work
    7. _Scheduling_ - listing the programming tasks necessary to complete your project and estimating how long each will take
    8. _Implementing_ - writing the code for your project by following the design and schedule created in the previous steps

2. Implementation Details
    1. **Documentation and Style** <br />
    As with all previous projects, your program must be well-written, well-documented, and readable.  This includes, but is not limited to:
        * organizing your scripts so that they can be read and comprehended easily
        * giving your sprites meaningful names
        * naming and using your variables, lists, and custom blocks well
        * including comments to describe the structure of your program and any particularly complex or unintuitive pieces of code
        * separating master sprites from clones, and cleaning up clones that are finished (see below)
    2. **Cloning** <br />
    The invaders and the projectiles should be implemented using prototyping.  A single master sprite should be implemented for each type and clones should be created each time a new instance of the sprite is needed.  The master sprites should be hidden throughout the program and should not take part in gameplay.
    3. **Required SNAP Elements** <br />
    Your program must include the following SNAP elements:
        * At least three variables
        * At least two custom blocks, at least one of which must take an argument

3. Required Checkpoints
    1. Have the player and a single invader moving correctly
    2. Be able to clone invaders and have the entire group move correctly
    3. Be able to fire projectiles from both the player (when the space bar is pressed) and the invaders (randomly)

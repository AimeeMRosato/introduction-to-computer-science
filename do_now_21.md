# Introduction to loops

Open this [starter project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=whuangpha&ProjectName=160205%20Do%20Now%20User%20Input), run the scrpt and test it, then answer these in your notebook.

1. What is the **forever** block, and why is it important for this program?
2. What happens if you take it out temporarily, reattach the rest of the script to the **When Green Flag clicked** block, and run the program?
3. What does the **point direction 90** do to the sprite?
4. What would happen if you decrease or increase the number of steps?
5. Add scripting so that if the user presses the left arrow key, the sprite faces the left direction and moves a few steps in that direction. Test to make sure that this works and also that right arrow key still works.
6. Save your project as _DoNow2.1_.

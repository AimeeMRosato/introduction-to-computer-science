## Instructor's Notes
1. Review pitches
    * Have students look at their revised pitches from yesterday.  Tell them that they will be choosing **one** to pursue as their final project.
    * If desired, give students a few minutes to rework their pitches or get more feedback from a classmate or instructor.
    * Ask students to choose which idea they want to pursue, and write it down on the top of their [Final Project Plan Organizer](Final Project Plan Organizer.docx).

* [Students will choose one idea from their ranked list as the final project they will implement and write a full spec.  The spec should be detailed enough that another student would be able to implement the project.]

## Instructor's Notes
1. Review pitches
    * Have students look at their revised pitches from yesterday.  Tell them that they will be choosing **one** to pursue as their final project.
    * If desired, give students a few minutes to rework their pitches or get more feedback from a classmate or instructor.
    * Ask students to choose which idea they want to pursue, and write it down on the top of their [Final Project Plan Organizer](Final Project Plan Organizer.docx).
2. Defining Scenarios
    * 
3. Wireframing
    * Define the term "wireframe" for students
        * _wireframe: a high-level sketch of an application's user interface intended to help visualize layout, interactions, and transitions_
    * Explain that wireframes do not include any details (such as specific graphics or text), but instead provide a broad impression of what an application will look like to aid in design and planning
    * Students will complete page 1 of the organizer by sketching or wireframing the important screens for their project.
        * If you have one available, a wireframing tool such as [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) can be used instead of sketching by hand.
        * As with all wireframing, students should not focus on the specific details of the sprites, images, etc. that will appear, but instead design the basic layout and main components of each screen.
        * Encourage students to think about _all_ necessary screens for their project, including simple things like a splash screen, help screen, or exit ("game over") screen.
4. Debrief
    * As class ends, remind students that their spec will be their guide throughout the process.  They should update it as necessary and keep it with them at all times.
    * Ideally, anytime there is a question about the project, the spec should have the answer.  If not, it's a new idea.

## Do Now 3.3 Custom Block Practice

1. Write a custom block named "bounce" that does the following:

  - move 10 steps

  - bounce off the edge of the screen using:

    ![if on edge, bounce](ifedgebounce.png)

2. After saving the custom block, create a script that when the flag is clicked, the "bounce" custom block is called forever.

3. Add a second script.  Add the same script from step 2 above for the new sprite.

4. What happens when you run?  Explain what you observe.

# Lesson 0.2


## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...
* Define "algorithm"
* Construct algorithms for performing simple tasks

## Materials/Preparation
Needed for this lesson:
* Supplies to create a peanut butter & jelly sandwich (ingredients, utensils, plates, napkins, etc.)
* Paper/writing implements for each group of students
  * Large poster paper and markers will allow for display of the algorithms, but standard paper will work fine

## Instructor's Notes

* Introductory discussion
  * Introduce students to the basic concepts and vocabulary of computer science.
  * Invite discussion about what constitutes a computer and what computers do.  
  * Present (or have the class develop) definitions for important terms ("computer," "program," "algorithm," etc.).  

* Activity
  * In pairs or small groups, students will attempt to develop an algorithm for preparing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Specify to students that their algorithm must be complete and detailed enough for a "computer" (person) to unambiguously follow the steps and achieve the desired result.
    * Give little guidance at this stage, as the confusion (and the errors that are likely to result) will both reinforce the importance of specificity and detail as well as provide entertainment value later on.
  * After groups have finished, choose a group and have them read their instructions.  Act as a computer and follow each step as literally as possible. If there is ambiguity, or if a step is not possible to complete, point out the error.
    * When an instruction is ambiguous or impossible, interpret the algorithm in the most atypical (and hilarious) way possible.  This will reinforce to students that many seemingly clear instructions can be taken many ways.
    * Most algorithms will fail.  If there is time, repeat the process with one or two other groups.
  * Spend a brief moment explaining that programming is an iterative process, and that errors are expected.  Introduce the concept of "debugging."  Then, have students "debug" their algorithms and attempt to fix all errors and ambiguities.
  * Once groups have finished debugging, repeat the execution process.  Hopefully, at this point, at least one algorithm will result in a proper sandwich.  
    * If not, try to debug on the fly. When you hear an incorrect or unclear instruction, point out the error and either propose or request a fix before proceeding.  The goal is to create a sandwich before the end of class.

* Debrief
  * Ask students to describe why there were problems with the first round of algorithms, and how those problems were fixed. Encourage the use of computer science terminology.
    * Keep students from fixating on the specifics of any one error and guide discussion to the general approaches and concepts used to resolve problems.
  * Have students discuss what lessons can be learned from this activity and how they can be applied to programming and computer science.

## Accommodations/Differentiation
* Check for food allergies before performing this exercise.  If any student has allergies that would put them at risk, substitute another food item or simulate the process with stand-in ingredients. 
* Students who have previous programming experience may tend to dominate the algorithm generation process.  Encourage these students to avoid pointing out errors directly and help the other members of their group find and fix errors.
* If students are struggling with the level of specificity required, allow them to make some basic assumptions to ease the process.
  * This can lead to an excellent conversation about abstraction.
* In the "debugging" round, some students may go overboard with the level of detail in an attempt to resolve all possible ambiguities.  Remind these students that there are some basic instructions that can be easily understood by most people, and there is no need to go into further detail in those cases.
  * If you feel students can handle the discussion, you can draw a parallel to machine code here.

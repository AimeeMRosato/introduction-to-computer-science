# Lesson 3.2

## Student Objectives
Students will be able to...
* Define the following terms in a computer science context:
    * abstraction
    * detail removal
    * generalization
    * procedural decomposition
* Describe how utilizing procedural decomposition can improve the readability and maintainability of algorithms and/or code
* Recognize opportunities to improve algorithms by abstracting or generalizing parts into subprocedures

## Materials/Preparation
* Student algorithms from lesson 0.2
    * If algorithms are not still available, either provide students with a canonical sample or have them recreate their algorithms as the first part of this lesson
* Paper/writing implements for each group of students

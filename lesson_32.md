## Instructor's Notes

<<<<<<< HEAD
  
1.  Introductory discussion
    -   Ask students to review (or recreate) their algorithms for preparing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (from lesson 0.2)
    -   Point out that some parts of the algorithm are similar or redundant
        -   e.g. spreading peanut butter repeatedly until enough is on the bread; spreading peanut butter and jelly are basically the same operation
    -   Define and discuss the following terms:
        -   _abstraction: removing the specifics that are not relevant in a given context_
            -   e.g. being able to drive a car without understanding how an internal combustion engine works
        -   _detail removal: reducing the complexity of an algorithm or process by focusing on the important parts_
            -   e.g. focusing simply on falling in the platform game instead of trying to create true parabolic motion
        -   _generalization: combining a group of related concepts or processes into a single category_
            -   e.g. spreading any condiment or ingredient onto a slice of bread (butter, jam, peanut butter, mayo, etc.)
        -   _procedural decomposition: breaking a problem down into smaller subtasks, usually to increase readability and/or maintainability, often by applying one of the above concepts_
2.  Activity, part 1
    -   Instruct students to review their PB&J algorithms looking for opportunities for abstraction and procedural decomposition and rewrite the algorithms to improve readability
        -   Possible opportunities include: abstracting spreading peanut butter and jelly, looping when spreading to get enough of the ingredient, removing details with regard to opening packages, etc.
    -   Encourage students to make their new algorithms as concise as possible while still being easy to understand
3.  Review
    -   Ask one or two groups to share their rewritten algorithms, pointing out the places where they abstracted or generalized
        -   If possible, choose groups with good approaches while circulating during the activity
    -   Ask other groups to point out any missed opportunities for or overuses of abstraction
    -   Discuss advantages to writing algorithms using abstraction
        -   More concise code, more structure, easier to follow, ability to ignore details until relevant
4.  Activity, part 2
    -   Have students return to their groups and develop an algorithm for constructing and cooking a [lasagna ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasagne)
        -   Encourage students to be aware of opportunities for abstraction and/or procedural decomposition when writing their algorithms
        -   As much as possible, students should abstract while writing the algorithm rather than writing a complete algorithm and then making edits
    -   Emphasize the balance between conciseness and readability
        -   Too much abstraction or generalization can make the algorithm hard to understand (e.g. end up with a "do stuff" procedure)
5.  Debrief
    -   Ask at least two new groups to share their lasagna algorithms
        -   Ask students not in either group to compare and contrast the presented algorithms
        -   Point out, or ask students to point out, uses of, missed opportunities for, and overuses of abstraction
    -   Ask students how the skills learned in this lesson can be applied to programming
        -   Drive students to realize that code is simply an application of algorithms
        -   Tease the need for custom blocks (procedures)
=======
1.	Lecture and Demonstration
	-	Review with students the concepts of abstraction, generalization, and detail removal
		-	Ask students to provide definitions and examples of each
	-	Discuss when abstraction can be used to help simplify code
		-	Guide students to realization that much code is used in many similar circumstances and shouldn’t be rewritten
		-	Emphasize potential for errors when changes are made in addition to inconvenience when code is redundant
	-	Demonstrate constructing a custom command block
		-	Use a simple example, such as jumping (from the platform game)
		-	If needed, use part 2.1 (drawing a square) as a further example
2.	Activity
	-	Students should complete the “Drawing Shapes (Again)” activity individually or in pairs
		-	Work with students to be certain that they are using custom blocks and variables as described by the activity
		-	Point out places where code can be abstracted and generalized
		-	Emphasize conciseness and clarity in code
3.	Review
	-	Discuss one or two student submissions
		-	Point out differences between different students’ solutions
		-	Point out missed opportunities for abstraction (if any)
		-	Discuss how this custom block can be useful

##BJC Lecture Suggestion
####Good for Classroom Instruction
 * [BJC Video Suggestion: BJC Lecture 4: Functions ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uKCBmQEf5w)
  - [MIT Scratch --> BYOB Snap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uKCBmQEf5w&t=10m0s)  (Development of SNAP, Demo) 10:00-11:30
  - [BYOB-Custom Blocks ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uKCBmQEf5w&t=10m0s)  (Explains functions with examples)   11:30-14:50


## Accommodation/Differentiation
-	In addition to attempting the bonus in the lab, advanced students can be encouraged to write a new custom block that draws a specified number of the given shape (for example, 2 squares or 5 hexagons).  The number of shapes should be taken as user input.
-	Struggling students can be given solution code for all of section 1.  Work with these students to answer the questions in part 1.5 so that they are prepared to attempt the custom block authoring.

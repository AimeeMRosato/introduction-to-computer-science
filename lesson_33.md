# Lesson 3.3

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Build custom SNAP blocks that take arguments

## Materials/Preparation

* Lab 3.4 handout (Let Me Check My Calendar)

## Pacing Guide

| Duration | Description |

| 25 minutes | Custom block argument activity |
| 15 minutes | Review and wrap-up |

## Instructor's Notes

* Lecture
  * Introduce block arguments
    * Ask students to speculate on risks of relying on variables instead of arguments
    * Emphasize importance of custom blocks being self-contained
    * Demonstrate declaration and usage of arguments
      * Point out that arguments are very similar to script variables, except their values come outside the bloc  
      * Explain argument types
    * Focus on text, numbers, and possibly Booleans
    * Ask students to describe why restricting types is important
*Activity
  * Students should complete the "Let Me Check My Calendar" activity individually or in pairs
    * This lab consists of a series of independent custom blocks.  The blocks need not necessarily be completed in the order given, but are roughly in order of difficulty.
    * The bonus (part 2.4) requires implementing a fairly complex formula.
* Review
  * Ask a different student to provide their solution to each part.  
  * If time allows, discuss multiple solutions to each part.
    * Emphasize differences and encourage discussion about advantages and disadvantages.
    * Point out corner cases and cases where typed arguments are particularly helpful.

## Accommodations/Differentiation
* Part 2.4 is a fairly complex formula and should be a challenge for advanced students.
* Struggling students should focus on section 1. The problems in section 2 represent more complex algorithms, but not necessarily any more difficult usage of arguments.

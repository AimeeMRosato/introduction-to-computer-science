## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...
  * Identify the main components of a functional project specification and explain the purpose of each section

## Instructor's Notes
3. Spec writing
    * Using the details from their pitch, their wireframes, and the feedback they've received, students should fill out the rest of the plan organizer.
        * It is **VITAL** at this stage that students be as detailed and thorough as they can.  Any missing information will complicate the process later when they realize what was left out.  Encourage students to take their time and make sure they hit everything.
        * While this process is happening, instructors should circulate through the class and check-in with student.  Verify that they have a complete, well-thought out idea that is feasible to complete in the available time.  
            * If you have concerns about a student's ability to complete the proposed project, help them scope down by removing or simplifying features.
4. Debrief
    * As class ends, remind students that their spec and implementation plan will be their guides throughout the process.  They should update them each day and keep them with them at all times.
    * Ideally, anytime there is a question about the requirements or scope of the project, the spec should have the answer.  If not, it's a new idea and the spec needs to be updated acordingly.

# It's around here somewhere

In this lab, you will implement several custom blocks performing variants of sequential search.

## Part 1: You there

1. Write your own version of the **contains** block. **contains** is a reporter block takes two arguments: a list and a value to search for in that list. The block reports true if the value is in the list and reports false otherwise.  Do not use Snap!'s pre-existing **contains** block in your solution.

## Part 2: Where

1. Write a custom block called **index of** that takes a list and a value as arguments and reports the index of the value found in the list.  If the value is not in the list, report -1. *Remember: an index is the numeric position of an item in a list. For example, in the list ['dog', 'cat', 'mouse'] the item 'dog' is at index 1 and the item 'mouse' is at index 3. Some programming languages index lists starting from 0, but Snap! begins with index 1 just like if you were counting the number of items in the list.*

## Part 3: Tell Me More

1. Write a custom block called **first e-word** that takes a list as an argument and reports the first word in the list that starts with the letter 'e'.  If no such word exists, report a blank (nothing).

2. Save your project as _Lab4.5_.

Bonus: Write a custom block called **first word that starts with** that takes both a list and a letter as arguments, and reports the first word in the list that starts with the given letter.  If no such word exists, report a blank (nothing).

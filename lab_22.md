# Lab 2.2 - Another Brick in the Wall
In this lab, you will use nested loops to draw a large brick wall using as little code as possible.

## Part 1 - Brick by Brick
1. Write a SNAP script to draw a single 20x10 "brick" in the lower left corner of the stage when the green flag is clicked.

2. Modify your code to draw two bricks side by side.  The bricks should share a short edge, like this: ![](two bricks.png)

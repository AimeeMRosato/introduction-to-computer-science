# Bouncing ball

1. Open a new project and change the sprite's costume to a ball.

2. Save your project as _DoNow2.6_

3. Using the following blocks, write a script that continuously moves the ball across the screen and bounces the ball when it hits the edge of the screen.

    ![if on edge, bounce](images/if_edge_bounce.png)

    ![when Green Flag clicked ](images/when_clicked.png)

    ![move 3 steps](images/move_3.png)

    ![forever](images/forever.png)

4. Add a second sprite.  Add the same script from step 2 above for the new sprite.

5. What happens when you run?  Explain what you observe.

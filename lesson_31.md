## Instructor's Notes
1. Lecture
    1. Review user input, specifically the ![](answer.png) block
        * Ask students to speculate about how the ![](answer.png) block works
            * Students should recognize that the block must be storing a value somehow and remembering it for later
        * Ask students whether that type of functionality might be useful in other cases
    2. Introduce variables
        * Define and explain the concept of a variable
            * _a "place" to store a value for retrieval and use later_
        * Demonstrate creating, assigning, and accessing a variable in SNAP
            * Ignore global vs. this sprite only for now
            * Point out that a variable can only hold one value at a time
                * When a new value is assigned, the old value is lost and cannot be recovered
            * Emphasize the importance of descriptive, readable names for variables
        * Show that variables are independent
            * One variable's value can be assigned to another, as in ![](setVar1ToVar2.png), but changing the value of `var2` later will not update the value of `var1`

2. Activity
    * Direct students to complete [Guessing Game](lab_31.md) individually or in pairs

# Lesson 5.2

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Demonstrate the difference between sprite and global variables
-   Explain how cloning and prototyping simplify working with numerous similar sprites in the same program
-   Create prototype sprites and clones of the prototype sprite

## Materials/Preparation

-   [Lab 5.2 handout](lab_52.md) (Lots of Balls)
    -   Test out the lab on student machines before class--  cloning in SNAP! can bring the web browser to a crawl on some machines

## Instructor's Notes

-   Introductory discussion
    -   Quick introduction the space invaders (<https://youtu.be/437Ld_rKM2s?t=15>)
    -   Thought experiment with the students: How do we create all the “invaders”?
        -   Answer with current knowledge: make one invader sprite, and copy it many times while adjusting the copies as necessary
    -   Introduce cloning as the automated way of doing the manual copying
    -   Demo and explain at a high level scripts the complete basketball lab
        -   Emphasize to the students that they will be doing this shortly and should focus on the concepts rather than implementation
-   Basketball lab part 1 has three pieces: 
    -   Starting with the basics <!-- http://tealsclass.com/mod/page/view.php?id=14791 -->
    -   Changing the control structure <!-- http://tealsclass.com/mod/page/view.php?id=14792 -->

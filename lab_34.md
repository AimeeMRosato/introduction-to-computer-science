# If My Calculations Are Correct...

In this lab, you will write custom reporter blocks to perform a number of useful calculations and computations.

## Simple Computations
1. Write a custom SNAP reporter block called "min" that determines which of two numbers is smaller and reports that value.

1. Write a custom SNAP reporter block called "max" that determines which of two numbers is larger and reports that value.

1. Write a custom SNAP predicate block called "between" that determines if a number is between two other numbers.  If the first number is equal to either of the other two numbers or is between them, the block should report "true".

1. Write a custom SNAP predicate called "at least as long as" that determines whether or not word has at least a specified number of letters.


## Stepping Things Up
1. Write a custom SNAP reporter block called "distance to" that computes and reports the distance from a sprite's position to another point.  Use the "x position" and "y position" blocks to determine the sprite's position.  Remember that the formula for the distance between points $(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$ is $\sqrt{((y2-y1)^2+(x2-x1)^2 )}$.

1. Write a custom SNAP predicate block called "contains letter" that determines whether or not a word contains a particular letter.  You can consider upper-case and lower-case letters to be different for the purposes of matching.

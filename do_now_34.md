# Practice using arguments

Last class, you created a **gravity** block where a sprite would fall to the ground and stop when it touched a color. The sprite always falls at the same rate.  How would we get the sprite to fall at different rates?

We will solve this problem by adding an argument to the **gravity** block.  We can then pass the rate we want the sprite to move.

1. Open your Donow34 script with the **gravity** block.

2. Add an argument named "rate" to the **gravity** block by clicking the "+" next to the block name.

3. Change the **move** block to move "rate" spaces by dragging the rate variable to the **move** block.

4. You can now pass different rates in your **gravity** block call located in the sprite's forever loop.

5. Save your project as _Donow34_.

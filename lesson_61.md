## Instructor's Notes
1. Introduce project
    * Talk about how far students have come this semester
        * Ask students to think back to the start of the semester and remember how little they knew about programming.
        * Briefly list a bunch of the things they've learned (drawing, animation, variables, loops, conditionals, loops, etc.)
        * Maybe show a lab or assignment from early on and remind them that, not that long ago, this was challenging, whereas it now seems nearly trival (hopefully).


* [Students will be led through an exercise to design an existing, popular application, such as Instagram, Twitter, etc.]
* [Expand on this...]

## Instructor's Notes

* Review and lecture
  * Review loops and conditionals
    * Ask students what loops do, when they are useful, and what loops exist in SNAP
    * Ask students what conditionals are for and when they are useful
    * Encourage discussion about previous activities
    * Fill in understanding gaps when necessary
  * Demonstrate combining loops and conditionals
    * Present "repeat until" and placing an "if" inside a "forever"
    * Ask students to suggest when these constructs might be useful
    * Point out that the condition in "repeat until" is a termination condition, while in "forever-if" it is a continuation condition
  * Introduce the concept of modeling
    * Ask students to suggest systems or concepts that might need to be modeled
    * Discuss important considerations when designing and implementing a model
      * Lead students to realize that most sacrifice some amount of accuracy or realism for simplicity
* Activity
  * Students should complete "What Goes Up..." lab individually
    * Mention that the code written in this lab will be helpful for the Platform Game project


## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Take care to ensure that all students have functional code by the end of the lab to avoid putting some students at a disadvantage starting the project
  * If many students struggle, consider releasing your own solution after the lab has been completed in class
  * Utilize TAs and advanced students to assist struggling students&mdash;it is vital that all students complete this lab in advance of starting the project
* Advanced students can consider increasing the realism of their gravity model by adding acceleration and/or beginning to implement jumping

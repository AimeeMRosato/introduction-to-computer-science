## Instructor's Notes

* Review
  * Review the categories of blocks and what each is for.
    * Put particular emphasis on Motion and Drawing, as those will be used for this assignment
  * Remind students about the iterative process of programming
    * Students may get frustrated throughout this activity; remind them that requiring multiple attempts to find the right solution is normal.
* Activity
  * Students should complete the "Triangles, Squares, and Stars, Oh My!" activity individually.
    * Point out that the shapes in part 2.1 are not necessarily listed from easiest to hardest, and that the scripts need not be written in the given order.
  * When students finish, have them turn in their project using whatever procedures you have set up.
* Review
  * Discuss one or two student solutions to creating each of the shapes
    * Either solicit volunteers or cold call.
    * Point out differences between student solutions and call attention to the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem

## Accommodations/Differentiation
* Advanced students can attempt the five-pointed star. If students finish that shape, encourage them to try more advanced shapes.
  * Examples: Kite, smiley face, student's initials
* Struggling students can either be paired or allowed to not complete certain shapes.
* Students who have not yet taken geometry may have difficulty determining the correct angles. Point out to them that geometric understanding is not necessaryâ€”the angles can be determined using trial and error.
* If most students are not equipped to figure out the angles on their own, provide diagrams like the one of a square in part 1.1 to assist.

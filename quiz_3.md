# Unit 3 Quiz Customization

## Learning Objectives

Formative assessment on student progress: To gauge student understanding, the addition of Unit quizzes has been added.  These are intended as low stakes formative assessments that allow students to visit topics at the end of the unit to reinforce learning.  They are open book giving students incentive to take good notes.  Ideally the quizzes are non-graded and students would reflect on the answers they got wrong in order to learn from their mistakes.

Quizzes are located in protected Introduction to Computer Science Instructor GitHub repository: [https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science-instructor](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science-instructor)

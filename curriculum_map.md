# Intro CS Curriculum Map

## Unit 0
| Lesson | Objectives |
| ------ | ---------- |

## Unit 1: SNAP Basics
| Lesson | Objectives | Lab |
| ------ | ---------- | --- |
| 1.1: Welcome to SNAP    | Define and identify "blocks," "scripts," "sprites," and "the stage" in SNAP. Write simple SNAP programs. Describe what simple SNAP programs do without executing the code.  | Welcome to SNAP! |
| 1.2: Building Blocks    |  Name the categories of blocks in SNAP and describe what the blocks in each category do. Describe the function of several common SNAP blocks. Be able to use common blocks to build simple SNAP programs. | SNAP Scavenger Hunt |
| 1.3: Drawing Shapes    | Construct simple algorithms to draw shapes. Convert algorithms into SNAP programs. | Squares and Triangles and Stars, Oh My! |
| 1.4: Animation    | Animate SNAP sprites using costume changes and movement. Trigger action in other sprites using broadcasts.  | Sprites in Action |
| 1.5: Nursery Rhyme Project    | Apply basic programming and SNAP skills to create an animated movie, play, nursery rhyme, or other scene. Practice good debugging skills to correct issues as they arise while programming  | Project 1: Animated Nursery Rhyme |



## Unit 2: Loop-de-Loop
| Lesson | Objectives | Lab |
| ------ | ---------- | --- |
| 2.1: Loops | Define "loop" in a programming context. Explain why loops are useful. Implement simple repeat and forever loops in SNAP. Utilize loops to reduce redundancy in code. | Squares and Triangles Redux |
| 2.2: Nested Loops | Use nested loops to solve programming problems. | Another Brick in the Wall |
| 2.3: Inputs and Conditionals | Ask for and receive user input in a SNAP program. Use simple conditional (if and if-else) blocks to alter control flow in a SNAP program. | What Shape Is That? | 
| 2.4: Boole in the House | Define and identify Boolean expressions and operators. Evaluate Boolean expressions. Utilize Boolean operators (and/or/not) to create compound conditions. | Triangle of All Kinds |
| 2.5: Combining Loops and Conditionals | Combine loops with conditionals to create models with repeated but conditional behavior. | What Goes Up... |
| 2.6: Platform Game Project | Use loops, variables, and Boolean expressions to implement a Super Mario Bros. style platform game. Practice good debugging skills to correct issues as they arise while programming. | Project 2: Platform Game |

## Unit 3: Variables and Customization
| Lesson | Objectives | Lab |
| ------ | ---------- | --- |
| 3.1: Variables | Use variables to track values throughout a program. | Guessing Game |
| 3.2: Abstraction and Friends | Define abstraction, detail removal, generalization, and procedural decomposition in a computer science context. Describe how utilizing procedural decomposition can improve the readability and maintainability of algorithms and/or code. Recognize opportunities to improve algorithms by abstracting or generalizing parts into subprocedures. | Drawing Shapes (Again) |
| 3.3: Customizing I: Arguments | Build custom SNAP blocks that take arguments. | Let Me Check My Calendar |
| 3.4: Customizing II: Reporters and Predicates | Build custom reporter and predicate blocks in SNAP. | If My Calculations Are Correct... |
| 3.5: Pong Project | Use custom blocks to implement a well-written version of Pong. Practice good style and conventions to create readable and maintainable code. | Project 3: Pong |

## Unit 4: Lists
| Lesson | Objectives | Lab |
| ------ | ---------- | --- |
| 4.1: Intro to Lists | Explain the concept of a "list" in a programming context. Identify scenarios in which lists are useful | [none] |
| 4.2: Static Lists | Create static lists in SNAP. Access elements of a list. Add and remove elements from a list. | You Talkin' to Me? |
| 4.3: List Practice I | Traverse a list, accessing each element one at a time. Perform operations combining all elements in a list. Select defined subsets of elements in a list. | Guess Who |
| 4.4: List Practice II | Traverse a list, accessing each element one at a time. Perform operations combining all elements in a list. Select defined subsets of elements in a list. | Number Cruncher |
| 4.5: Sequential Search | Explain the sequential search algorithm. Implement several variations of sequential search. | It's Around Here Somewhere |
| 4.6: Hangman Project | Use lists to implement a complete version of "Hangman." Exercise good programming practices to produce code that is not only functional but also elegant and well-written. | Project 4: Hangman |

## Unit 5: Cloning
| Lesson | Objectives | Lab |
| ------ | ---------- | --- |
| 5.1: Intro to Cloning | Explain why prototyping and clones can be useful. Describe how complex goals can be accomplished using cloning. | Connect the Dots |
| 5.2: Cloning Sprites | Demonstrate the difference between sprite and global variables. Explain how cloning and prototyping simplify working with numerous similar sprites in the same program. Create prototype sprites and clones of the prototype sprite. Explain the difference between a "master" sprite and a "clone" sprite. | Lots of Balls |
| 5.3: Basketball Lab | Pass information to individual clones. [Optional] Describe a race condition that might occur due using global variables and clones. |

# Intro CS Curriculum Map

## Unit 1
| Lesson | Objectives |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 1.1: Welcome to SNAP    | Define and identify "blocks," "scripts," "sprites," and "the stage" in SNAP. Write simple SNAP programs. Describe what simple SNAP programs do without executing the code.  |
| 1.2: Building Blocks    |  Name the categories of blocks in SNAP and describe what the blocks in each category do. Describe the function of several common SNAP blocks. Be able to use common blocks to build simple SNAP programs. |
| 1.3: Drawing Shapes    | Construct simple algorithms to draw shapes. Convert algorithms into SNAP programs. |
| 1.4: Animation    | Animate SNAP sprites using costume changes and movement. Trigger action in other sprites using broadcasts.  |
| 1.5: Nursery Rhyme Project    | Apply basic programming and SNAP skills to create an animated movie, play, nursery rhyme, or other scene. Practice good debugging skills to correct issues as they arise while programming  |



## Unit 2
| Lesson | Objectives |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 2.1: Loops | Define "loop" in a programming context. Explain why loops are useful. Implement simple repeat and forever loops in SNAP. Utilize loops to reduce redundancy in code. |
| 2.2: Nested Loops | Use nested loops to solve programming problems. |
| 2.3: Inputs and Conditionals | Ask for and receive user input in a SNAP program. Use simple conditional (if and if-else) blocks to alter control flow in a SNAP program. |
| 2.4: Boole in the House | Define and identify Boolean expressions and operators. Evaluate Boolean expressions. Utilize Boolean operators (and/or/not) to create compound conditions. |
| 2.5: Combining Loops and Conditionals | Combine loops with conditionals to create models with repeated but conditional behavior. |
| 2.6: Platform Game Project | Use loops, variables, and Boolean expressions to implement a Super Mario Bros. style platform game. Practice good debugging skills to correct issues as they arise while programming. |

## Unit 3
| Lesson | Objectives |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 3.1: Variables | Use variables to track values throughout a program. |
| 3.2: Abstraction and Friends | Define abstraction, detail removal, generalization, and procedural decomposition in a computer science context. Describe how utilizing procedural decomposition can improve the readability and maintainability of algorithms and/or code. Recognize opportunities to improve algorithms by abstracting or generalizing parts into subprocedures. |
| 3.3: Customizing I: Arguments | Build custom SNAP blocks that take arguments. |
| 3.4: Customizing II: Reporters and Predicates | Build custom reporter and predicate blocks in SNAP. |
| 3.5: Pong Project | Use custom blocks to implement a well-written version of Pong. Practice good style and conventions to create readable and maintainable code. |

## Unit 4
| Lesson | Objectives |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 4.1: Intro to Lists | Explain the concept of a "list" in a programming context. Identify scenarios in which lists are useful |
| 4.2: Static Lists | Create static lists in SNAP. Access elements of a list. Add and remove elements from a list. |
| 4.3: List Practice I | Traverse a list, accessing each element one at a time. Perform operations combining all elements in a list. Select defined subsets of elements in a list. |
| 4.4: List Practice II | Traverse a list, accessing each element one at a time. Perform operations combining all elements in a list. Select defined subsets of elements in a list. |
| 4.5: Sequential Search | Explain the sequential search algorithm. Implement several variations of sequential search. |
| 4.6: Hangman Project | Use lists to implement a complete version of "Hangman." Exercise good programming practices to produce code that is not only functional but also elegant and well-written. |

## Unit 5
| Lesson | Objectives |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 5.1: Intro to Cloning | Explain why prototyping and clones can be useful. Describe how complex goals can be accomplished using cloning. |
| 5.2: Cloning Sprites | Demonstrate the difference between sprite and global variables. Explain how cloning and prototyping simplify working with numerous similar sprites in the same program. Create prototype sprites and clones of the prototype sprite. Explain the difference between a "master" sprite and a "clone" sprite. |
| 5.3: Basketball Lab | Pass information to individual clones. [Optional] Describe a race condition that might occur due using global variables and clones. |

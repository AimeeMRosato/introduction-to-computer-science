# Letters of a word

1. Open this [starter script](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=whuangpha&ProjectName=Starter%20project%20for%20text%20operators%20practice) and run the script.

2. Once you understand how it works, modify the script so that the sprite says every letter in the word.

3. Save your project as _Donow42_.

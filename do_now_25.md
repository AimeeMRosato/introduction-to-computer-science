# Variables practice

## In your notebook

1. Write an algorithm, in English, for how you would swap the values in two variables. For example, suppose we have two variables that have different values:

   * set `playerOneValue` to "Torch"

   * set `playerTwoValue` to "Gold"

2. How would you swap the values so `playerOneValue` is set to "Gold" and `playerTwoValue` is set to "Torch"?

   * Here, "Torch" and "Gold" are just examples. Suppose the algorithm doesn't know what values the variables have before it begins.

3. Swap your algorithm with a partner and test it to determine if it works or not.

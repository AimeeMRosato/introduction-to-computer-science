## Do Now 2.5 Variables Practice

1. Write down an algorithm in English how you would swap the values in two variables.

   For example two players want to swap two values:

      playerOneValue is set to "Torch"
   
      playerTwoValue is set to "Gold"

   How would you swap the values so playerOneValue is set to "Gold" and playerTwoValue is set to "Torch"?

   Note, the values can change over time so you cannot assume the valuess will always be a "Torch" and "Gold".

2.  Swap your algorithm with a partner and test it to determine if it works or not.

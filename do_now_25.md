## Do Now 2.5 Variables Practice

1. Write down an algorithm in English how you would swap the values in two variables.

   For example two players want to swap two objects:

   playerOneObject = "Torch"
   
   playerTwoObject = "Gold"

   How would you swap the objects so playerOneObject is "Gold" and playerTwoObject is "Torch"?

   Note, the objects can change over time so you cannot assume the objects will always be a "Torch" and "Gold".

2.  Swap your algorithm with a partner and test it to determine if it works or not.

# Introduction to Computer Science Principles

<!-- TODO: Name of the course: Intro to CSP is good in terms of
aligning the class with other standards, but we need a more exciting
name to attract students! -->

Welcome to the new TEALS Intro CS Curriculum!

As of 7/15/2015, the curriculum is still **under heavy
construction**. Feel free to browse around, but expect major changes
and additions over the coming weeks. We anticipate officially
launching the curriculum by 7/24/2015.

The **Intro CS curriculum guide** can be found
[here](https://teals.sharepoint.com/curriculum/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B6AB1E507-C200-44D9-9A58-C56FCE9A3A0B%7D&file=TEALS%20Intro%20CS%20Curriculum%20Guide%202014.docx&action=default)
. As of 7/15/2015, it is not the updated version for the 2015-2016
school year, but the differences between the two versions are
minor. An updated version will be available once the curriculum is
launched.

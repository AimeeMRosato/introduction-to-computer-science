<!-- TODO: Name of the course: Intro to CSP is good in terms of aligning the class with other standards, but we need a more exciting name to attract students! -->

Welcome to the new TEALS Intro CS Curriculum!

As of 7/10/2015, the curriculum is still **under heavy construction**. Feel free to browse around, but expect major changes and additions over the coming weeks. We anticipate officially launching the curriculum by 7/24/2015.

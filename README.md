# Introduction to Computer Science Principles

<!-- TODO: Name of the course: Intro to CSP is good in terms of
aligning the class with other standards, but we need a more exciting
name to attract students! -->

Welcome to the new TEALS Intro CS Curriculum!

As of 7/15/2015, the curriculum is still **under heavy
construction**. Feel free to browse around, but expect major changes
and additions over the coming weeks. We anticipate officially
launching the curriculum by 7/24/2015.

While we finish the curriculum materials, you can view the old version of the **Intro CS curriculum guide** by visiting the TEALS Dashboard and clicking on "Additional Curriculum Materials." Once SharePoint loads, navigate to "Other Curriculum Materials" on the left navigation. You should see the Intro CS Guide document in the library. This document is somewhat out of date, but will give you the overall structure of the course. A replacement will appear as part of this gitbook prior to 7/24/2015.

# Lesson 2.6   <!-- Formerly 2.7 -->

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Use loops, variables, and Boolean expressions to implement a Super Mario Bros. style platform game.
* Practice good debugging skills to correct issues as they arise while programming.



## Materials/Preparation

* Reference to the Platform Game project: [Platform Game](project_2.md)
* [Optional] Printouts of the specification 
* A few suggested themes available for students who may struggle to come up with their own.
* Suggestions for characters, power-ups, goals, etc.

## Instructor's Notes

1. Review/Introduction
  * Play a review game (such as [GrudgeBall](http://toengagethemall.blogspot.com/2013/02/grudgeball-review-game-where-kids-attack.html)) to remind students of the skills and concepts have been learned in this unit.
    * Basic loops
    * Nested loops
    * User input
    * Conditional blocks
    * Advanced (conditional) loops)
    * Boolean logic
  * Remind students that their solutions to previous assignments are an excellent resource when trying to accomplish similar tasks.
2. Introduce project
  * Walk students through the project specification, pointing out important details, potential pitfalls, and requirements.
    * If students are unfamiliar with the concept of a platform game, spend a couple minutes demonstrating one for the class.  If you have a SNAP or Scratch version, that works best, but an online game (such as [Super Mario Flash](http://www.pouetpu-games.com/index.php?section=2&game_id=1&w=640&h=480)) will work as well.
    * Discourage students from simply recreating a game they are already familiar with (and using copyrighted assets) and encourage them to be creative and design their own characters and world instead.
    * Static screens are somewhat easier to implement than smooth scrolling, but scrolling is doable with some scaffolding.
3. Project
  * This is a summative assessment project.  Students should be given at least a few days in class to work on the project.  The exact schedule should be determined by your teaching team based on overall class capability and other factors.
    * If most students have the ability to work at home, you can consider reducing the amount of in-class time provided and requiring students to spend time working at home.
  * Provide a means for students to ask questions throughout the project and provide assistance as needed.


## Accommodations/Differentiation

* If any students do not have the ability to work at home, ensure enough in-class time is provided to complete the assignment, offering extensions if necessary.
* Advanced students can be encouraged to extend their games beyond the minimum required number of screens, add more features (advanced power-ups, "boss" enemies, secret screens, etc.), create multiple "levels" that must be worked through, or any other extension.
* Struggling students can be exempted from certain requirements or given starter code.
  * If scaffolding this project, provide code to perform some of the various actions required in the game (changing screens, moving the character, defeating enemies, activating power-ups, etc.) and ask the students to fill in the triggers and conditions for using these routines.

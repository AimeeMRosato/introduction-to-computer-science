# Lab 2.3 - What Shape is That?
In this lab, you will use user input and conditional statements to identify shapes based on the number of sides and some other properties as given by the user.

## Part 1 - Triangle...or no triangle?
1. Write a SNAP program that asks the user to think of a shape and input how many sides it has.  Then, if the user is thinking of a triangle, tell him or her so.  Regardless of whether or not the shape was a triangle, thank the user for playing.
2. Modify your program to give an appropriate message both when the user _is_ thinking of a triangle and when he or she is _not_ thinking of a triangle.  Give the same thank you message afterward in either case.

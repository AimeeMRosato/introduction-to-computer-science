# Lesson 5.1: Intro to cloning

## Learning objectives

Students will be able to...

* Explain why prototyping and clones can be useful.
* Describe how complex goals can be accomplished using cloning.

## Materials and preparation

* [5.1 slide deck](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/slidedecks/TEALS%20SNAP%205.1.pptx)
* [Lab 5.1 - Connect the dots](lab_51.md) ([docx](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%205%20Word/Lab%205.1%20Connect%20the%20Dots.docx)) ([pdf](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%205%20PDF/Lab%205.1%20Connect%20the%20Dots.pdf))
* If possible, create large poster-sized versions of the dot grids (each grid is 12 x 3).

## Instructor's notes

### Introduce activity

Inform students that they will be drawing some figures by following specific instructions.

Emphasize that students must follow all instructions in the lab carefully.

Throughout the activity, ask students to think about other ways they could accomplish the same goals and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

### Activity

Split students into diverse groups of at least six.  If the number of students is not an exact multiple of six, create a few groups of seven and have students take turns being "active".

* Students should follow the steps in the lab, being careful to act as a group.

In each part, the group will draw the letter 'C' six times, using slightly different instructions.

* Students should, hopefully, notice that in part 3, they are able to achieve similar but not exactly the same results by all following the same instructions.  (Though each student draws a 'C', they are not all in the same location.)  In each part, they were able to improve the efficiency and clarity of the instructions.

### Debrief

Ask each group to share their answers to the questions at the end of each part.

Discuss how this approach could be applied to programming.

Introduce the terms _prototyping_ and _cloning_ as synonyms:

_Prototyping:_ creating a single "master" entity that defines the behavior for a group of objects, then creating many copies of the prototype to duplicate the behavior.

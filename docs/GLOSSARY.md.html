# Glossary

## A

### Abstraction
Removing the specifics that are not relevant in a given context.

**Related:** [Unit 6: Customization](unit_03)

### Argument 
Any area in a block that accepts user input, or another block. It could be a Boolean Block or a value placed inside of a variable or block. The value that is "passed into" a parameter of a custom block.

**Related:** [Unit 6: Customization](unit_03)

## B

### Backgrounds
Pictures that fill the entire stage area. 

### Block
Puzzle-piece shapes that are used to create code in snap!

**Related:** [Unit 1: SNAP Basics](unit_01)

### Boolean Expression
A value (text, number, picture, etc.) that evaluate to true or false.

**Related:** [Unit 2: Loops](unit_02)

### Boolean Operators
Boolean expressions that can be nested.

**Related:** [Unit 2: Loops](unit_02)


## C

### Command Block
Puzzle-piece shaped block that executes a command (it causes an effect).

**Related:** [Unit 6: Customization](unit_03)

### Cloning
A feature that allows a sprite to create a clone, or semi-duplicate, of itself, while the project is running. Clones of a sprite will be the same as the original or parent sprite but as a separate instance. Clones inherit the parent's scripts, costumes, sounds, and properties, yet they can then be modified.

**Related:** [Unit 5: Cloning](unit_05)

### Conditional 
A block used to make a choice between executing two different chunks of code."If" statements.

**Related:** [Unit 2: Loops](unit_02)

### Contains Block
Checks an operator block for a particular variable.

**Related:** [Unit 4: Lists](unit_04)

### Costume
A costume is one out of possibly many "frames" or alternate appearances of a sprite.

**Related:** [Unit 1: SNAP Basics](unit_01)

### Custom Blocks
Allow for one to make their own programming blocks.

**Related:** [Unit 6: Customization](unit_03)

## D

Reducing the complexity of an algorithm or process by focusing on the important parts.

**Related:** [Unit 6: Customization](unit_03)

## E

`No E entries`

## F

### Functions/Methods
Other programming languages, like Python or Java, use these terms to refer to the same idea as a Custom Block in Snap! a reusable.

**Related:** [Unit 2: Loops](unit_02)

## G

### Generalization
Combining a group of related concepts or processes into a single category.

**Related:** [Unit 6: Customization](unit_03)

### Global Variable
A variable that can be used by all of your sprites.

**Related:** [Unit 5: Cloning](unit_05)

## H

`No H entries`

## I

### Index Variable
Keeps track of where you currently are in a list.

**Related:** [Unit 4: Lists](unit_04)

## J

### Join Block
Links two values together and reports the result.

**Related:** [Unit 4: Lists](unit_04)

### Jukebox
A collection of sounds that can be applied to a sprite costume. 

## K

`No K entries`

## L

### Lists Block
A block which controls a list.
**Related:** [Unit 4: Lists](unit_04)

### List Element
A part of a list.

**Related:** [Unit 4: Lists](unit_04)

### Loop
A type of block that causes other code to run multiple times in succession. A control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.

**Related:** [Unit 2: Loops](unit_02)

## M

### Modeling
Building a system to simulate the behavior of a real-life phenomenon by simplifying or ignoring certain details.

**Related:** [Unit 2: Loops](unit_02)

## N

### Nested Loop
A loop used inside the body of another loop.

**Related:** [Unit 2: Loops](unit_02)

### Operator Block
A block that performs math functions and string handling.

**Related:** [Unit 4: Lists](unit_04)

Breaking a problem down into smaller subtasks, usually to increase readability and/or maintainability, often by applying one of the above concepts.

**Related:** [Unit 6: Customization](unit_03)

### Programming List
Called an 'array' in most programming languages, this holds lots of values.

**Related:** [Unit 4: Lists](unit_04)

## Q

`No Q entries`

## R

### Receive Block
Code Block in Control that receives a message from another block.

**Related:** [Unit 1: SNAP Basics](unit_01)

### Reporter Block
Report a value, usually for use in another block's input slot.

**Related:** [Unit 6: Customization](unit_03)

## S

**Related:** [Unit 6: Final Project](unit_06)

### Snap!
Snap! is an extended reimplementation of [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) that allows you to Build Your Own Blocks.  It also features ﬁrst class lists, ﬁrst class procedures, first class sprites, first class costumes, first class sounds, and first class continuations.  These added capabilities make it suitable for a serious introduction to computer science for high school or college students.

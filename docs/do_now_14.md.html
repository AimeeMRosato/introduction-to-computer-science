# Example animation

## Follow these steps on your own

1. Open this [starter script](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=andrewspiece&ProjectName=Do_Now%201.4_Starter).

2. Log into your Snap! account and save the starter project.

3. Save your project as _Donow15_.

4. Press the space bar on your keyboard several times in a row. Notice what happens to the two bats on the screen.

    >Hint: If a sprite moves completely off the Stage, you can bring the sprite back on the Stage by right-clicking its icon in the Sprite Corral and choosing `show`.

5. Use your mouse to point the cursor at one of the bats. Then, click the mouse button several times.  Notice what happens to the two bats on the screen.

6. Take a look at all of the parts of the Snap! window. Read the comments in the script.  Be sure to explore the tabs at the top of the scripting area and the icons in the Sprite Corral.
  
    > Hint: It may be helpful to activate "visual steps" with the footprint icon near the middle of the top tool bar.

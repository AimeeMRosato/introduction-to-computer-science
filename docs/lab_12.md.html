# Scavenger hunt

In this lab, you will explore the functionality of some common blocks and where they are in the palette.

## Part 1: Locating common blocks

1. Fill in the name of the category to which each block belongs in the chart below. The first one is already filled in for example.

| Block                                       | Category |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| ![point in direction](images/point_in_direction.png) | _motion_ |
| ![think](images/think.png)                         |          |
| ![play notes](images/play_notes.png)                |          |
| ![set pen color](images/set_pen_color.png)           |          |
| ![glide](images/glide.png)                         |          |
| ![repeat](images/repeat.png)                       |          |
| ![change pen size](images/change_pen_size.png)       |          |
| ![set effect](images/set_effect.png)                |          |
| ![go to x-y](images/go_to_x_y.png)                   |          |
| ![set size](images/set_size.png)                    |          |
| ![rest for beats](images/rest_for_beats.png)         |          |
| ![point towards](images/point_towards.png)          |       |

## Part 2: What does it do

1. Describe the function of each block in the chart below. If the block accepts arguments (contains values that you can change), be sure to test out a few different ones to make sure you fully understand what those values mean. The first one is already filled in for example.

    | Block   | Function   |
    | --- | --- |
    | ![point in direction](images/point_in_direction.png) | _Changes the direction that the sprite is facing. The argument indicates the number of degrees the sprite turns clockwise from pointing upwards. When the argument is "90", the sprite points right, and so on._ |
    | ![think](images/think.png)  |      |
    | ![play notes](images/play_notes.png) |     |
    | ![set pen color](images/set_pen_color.png)|   |
    | ![glide](images/glide.png)  |     |
    | ![repeat](images/repeat.png)          |     |
    | ![change pen size](images/change_pen_size.png)        |    |
    | ![set effect](images/set_effect.png)  |    |
    | ![go to x-y](images/go_to_x_y.png)        |      |
    | ![set size](images/set_size.png)    |             |
    | ![rest for beats](images/rest_for_beats.png) | |
    | ![point towards](images/point_towards.png)  |    |

2. At this point, you may be noticing some patterns. Use what you've learned from exploring these blocks. What do the blocks in the indicated pallette do?
  
    | Pallette   | Function   |
    | --- | --- |
    |Motion| |
    |Looks| |
    |Sound| |
    |Pen | |

## Part 3: Put it all together

You are now going to use some of the blocks you've explored to create, save, and submit your program.

1. Create a script that plays 4 different notes with at least 2 rests in between.
2. Use the **repeat** block to play the song you create in number 1 in a loop.
3. Create a script that initializes the sprite at position (-20, 10). Then, have the sprite draw a shape that has at least 2 different colors and 2 different line thicknesses. _An example would be a square that has 2 thin red sides, and 2 thick blue sides._
4. Save your project as _Lab1.2_.

## Grading rubric

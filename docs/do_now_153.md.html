1. Open this [starter project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=whuangpha&ProjectName=160201%20Do%20Now%20Bat%20and%20Dragon).

2. Save your project as _DoNow1.5.3_.

3. Look at the bat's program and how events are triggered by two different keys. Trace through the scripts to understand how the it works.

4. Modify the script so that the bat flies to the Dragon when the space key is pressed once.
5. Add to the script to have the bat to say "BOO!" when it stops.
6. Add to the script to have the dragon turn around and say, "You scared me!".
7. Add to the script to have the Bat to then turn around and fly away.

# Practice using arguments

Open your _DoNow3.3_ program. In this program, you created a **gravity** block where a sprite would fall to the ground and stop when it touched a color. The sprite always falls at the same rate.  

How would we get the sprite to fall at different rates?

We will solve this problem by adding an argument to the **gravity** block.  We can then pass the rate we want the sprite to move.

1. Add an argument named "rate" to the **gravity** block by clicking the "+" next to the block name.

2. Change the **move** block to move "rate" spaces by dragging the rate variable to the **move** block.

3. You can now pass different rates in your **gravity** block call located in the sprite's forever loop.

4. Save your project as _DoNow3.4_.

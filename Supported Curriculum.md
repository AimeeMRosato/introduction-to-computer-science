# Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome to TEALS Introduction to Computer Science!

The **Introduction to Computer Science** course is designed to introduce students to problem solving using programming constructions. Students will use either a block based or text based programming language to create programs of varying degrees of complexity.  At the end of most courses, students will create a project of their own choosing to design, develop, and refine their idea.

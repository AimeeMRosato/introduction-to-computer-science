# Lab 3.1 - Guessing Game
In this lab, you will use conditional statements and variables to build a simple number guessing game.

## Section 1 - I'm Thinking of a Number...
You will write a SNAP program to choose a random number between 1 and 10 and then ask the user to guess a number.  If the user's guess matches the random number, the user wins.  If not, the user loses.  In either case, the user should be shown a message indicating whether he won or lost and the secret random number should be revealed.

1. Fill out a [Planning Worksheet](SNAP Program Design and Planning Worksheet.docx) for the above program.

2. Write the simple version of the guesing game program described above.

3. Modify the program to keep asking the user for guesses until the correct number is given.  Be sure to give a message after each guess, but only reveal the secret number when the user has guessed correctly and the game is over.

4. Add code to ask the player their name at the start of the game.  Then, personalize the message for an incorrect guess by adding the player's name.  For example, if Sarah is playing the game, then the message should say "Sorry, Sarah, that guess is not correct" instead of just "Sorry" when Sarah guesses incorrectly.

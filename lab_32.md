# What goes up

In this lab, you will use everything you've learned about loops and conditionals to construct a simple model for gravity.

## Part 1: Before You Start

1. Open [https://aka.ms/Intro-lab3-2](https://aka.ms/Intro-lab3-2).

2. Save your project as _Lab3.2_.

## Part 2: Channeling newton

Write a script for the Dino sprite so that:

1. When the `green flag` is clicked, Dino goes to the top of the stage.

2. When the `green flag` is clicked, Dino falls to the bottom of the stage in a **forever** block.

3. When Dino touches the ground, Dino stops falling.

When using the **touching color** block, change the color by clicking on the color box, then select anything in the color palette or stage that has the desired color.

## Part 3: What goes up, must come down

1. Modify your script so that when the `green flag` is clicked, Dino will move to the top of the stage and it will move to a random x-coordinate between -240 and 240.  Use the **pick random** block in the scriptoperators category.

2. Modify your script so that the Dino sprite stops falling when it touches the ground or it is touching the Platform.  

## Part 4: Jump up

1. Modify your script so that when the `spacebar` is pressed, Dino will jump up.  

2. Have Dino jump by using a **repeat** block with a **change in y** block in it that will move Dino up.  Dino will have to move up faster than you think since it will be fighting the **forever** block that causes it to always go down.

## Part 5: Challenge

1. Modify your script so Dino can only jump while on the ground or the platform?

2. Add script so Dino will move left and right with the `arrow` keys?

## Instructor's Notes
* Utilize the plan developed with your teaching team for the first day of school.
    * The pacing guide above is a very broad suggestion.  You should adapt (or ignore) as necessary to fit your team's plan.
* Suggested topics to cover:
    * Names and backgrounds of TEALS team members
    * Brief background on TEALS program (i.e. "Why are there so many adults here?")
    * Classroom rules, behavior expectations, grading guidelines, late work policies, etc.
    * Academic Integrity/Cheating policy
    * Introductions/Icebreakers with students
    * High-level learning objectives for course

## Accommodation/Differentiation
* In some school's the first day of schools is an altered or shortened schedule.  Find this out ahead of time and plan for however much time you have available.
    * If necessary, split these topics across multiple days.
